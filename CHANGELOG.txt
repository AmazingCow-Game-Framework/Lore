[Version 0.1.2] - Jun 16, 2016.
-- General -- 
    A lot of bugfixes and assertions adding.

-- Sources --
    include/SDLHelpers.h
    src/SDLHelpers.cpp
        - [BUGFIX] SDL cannot create textures with size 0
          so make sure that this cannot happens.
    
    src/ITranformable.cpp
        - Add assertions.
    
    include/Texture.h
    src/Texture.cpp
        - Add an unique_ptr typedef.
        - Change the name of iVar to better reflect that it's
          a SDL Type.
        - Add assertions.
        - Cosmetic Changes.

    include/Font.h
    src/Font.cpp
        - Change the return type of prepareTexture to Texture::UPtr
          Strangely (or for some ignorance of my part) with the
          std::shared_ptr we were getting segmentation fault errors.
          Now it seems to be fixed.
        - Change the iVar name to better reflect that it's a SDL type.
        - Add assertions.
        - Change the prepareTexture method to only do the job if
          there is a string.
    
    include/Text.h
    src/Text.cpp
        - Fix the CTOR initialization.
        - Only draw if there is a valid texture.
        - Change the calculate method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Version 0.1.1] - Jun 15, 2016.
-- General -- 
    - Change from NDEBUG to LORE_RELEASE
      This enable us to generate "NDEBUG" (for std stuff)
      while have logs for Lore. When the we are ready
      we can just use -DLORE_RELEASE to get rid of them.

-- Sources -- 
    src/private/include.log
        - Cosmetic changes.
        - Change from NDEBUG to LORE_RELEASE.
        

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Version 0.1.0] - Jun 12, 2016.
-- General -- 
    - Finish the **very** basic implementation of Lore. 
      This is version used in Game_Kaboom.
